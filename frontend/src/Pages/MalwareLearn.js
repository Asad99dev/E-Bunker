      <h1>What is malware?</h1>
      <div className="content-container">
        Malware is a term used to describe a program or code that is harmful to
        a computer system. They are used by criminals to either gain access to
        your system, or to take something from the sytem such as payment
        information. Most malware is commonly distributed through emails, namely
        in the form of phishing and through downloading programs infected with
        malware.

      <h1>Types of malware</h1>
      <div className="content-container">
        <p>Malware comes in many forms, here are some of the common types:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            Virus: This what most people tend to think of when they hear
            malware. A virus is a type of malware that attaches itself to
            another program then replicates itself by modifying other programs
            with its own malicious code when the program is executed.
          </li>
          <li>
            Worms: Worms are similar to viruses as they are also
            self-replicating but unlike viruses, they do not need to attach
            themselves to other programs and spread across systems on their own.
          </li>
          <li>
            Trojan: A trojan is malware that disguises itself as something
            legitimate but instead executes malicious code when executed. Once
            they have access to the system, they can steal sensitive information
            or install other types of malware.
          </li>
          <li>
            Adware: Adware is malware that shows advertisements throughout your
            device which can make it difficult to navigate. They are typically
            installed unknowingly bundled with software.
          </li>
          <li>
            Keylogger: A type of malware that tracks every keystroke the user
            makes, leading the malware provider to know everything you type such
            as passwords and financial information.
          </li>
          <li>
            Ransomware: Ransomware is an increasingly common type of malware
            that can encrypt all your files leaving you unable to access them. A
            criminal then demands you pay a sum, usually in cryptocurrency as it
            is hard to trace, to them to get a decryption code so you can gain
            access to your files again. In recent years, this is becoming
            increasingly common with criminals targeting businesses that are
            likely to payout as well code required for ransomware being easily
            found in online criminal marketplaces.
          </li>
          <li>
            Cryptojacking: A newer type of malware that uses your system to mine
            cryptocurrency into their wallet. This can make powerful PCs operate
            very slowly as your PC horsepower is being used to mine
            cryptocurrency for the criminal.{" "}

      <h1>How can you protect yourself against malware</h1>
      <div className="content-container">
        <p>
          Most malware these days are delivered through phishing, to this end
          you can visit our page on phishing where we tell you how you can avoid
          becoming a victim of phishing. Other than phishing, it is important to
          exercise caution when using the internet such as not clicking pop up
          ads and staying away from sketchy sites promising free games and
          software. Finally, it is important to keep your operating system and
          software up to date. This is because updates to these tend to come
          with updated security that patch any vulnerabilities that may have
          been found. It is also recommended that you make regular backups of
          any data you wish to protect as malware could happen at any time,
          therefore it is best to have secure backups available so you do not
          lose your data.
        </p>
      </div>
      <h1>What happens if you have malware?</h1>
      <div className="content-container">
        <p>
          If you suspect you have malware, it is imperative that you run a scan
          immediately with an antivirus software. If the antivirus has found
          threats, it is important to let the software deal with it. Once this
          is complete, it is strongly recommended that you change all your
          passwords for your account as it is possible the malware may have
          retrieved your details before you have discovered. This is also a good
          time to check whether you have two-factor authentication enabled where
          possible which adds an extra layer of security so just your password
          is not enough to gain access to your accounts. If you want to be
          completely sure the malware has been eradicated, you can reinstall a
          fresh copy of your operating system which will remove all traces of
          the malware. However this comes with the cost of losing all your data
          if you don't have any backups. However it is up to the user whether
          this is worth it for the peace of mind.
