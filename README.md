e-bunker aims to be a platform where users can either begin their journey to become aware of cybersecurity threats and learn how to protect themselves online or for users looking to brush up their knowledge as the world of technology continues to move forward relentlessly, inviting new methods of targeting user's sensitive data. We hope that after using our platform, users will feel more confident browsing the internet as well as navigating different technology.
